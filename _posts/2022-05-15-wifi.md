#### My understanding of how wifi works:

A wifi being just a radio wave signal sends out packets at certain frequencies to transmit and receive data. Before connection, wifi sends out beacon packets everywhere all the time, its mostly once every 150ms. Thus this consumes power even when your router is not in use. To reduce power consumption and increase transmission, beacon packets are generally sent over a period of time thus they can effectively reach large distances. So when you open the wifi signal settings essentially our pc/phone displays all the beacon packets that it has received. Another fascinating thing I learned in the CPhile video was that two routers cannot send packets at the same frequency at the same time because that causes destructive interference so routers have a â€˜listen first then transmit policy wherein they if anyone one router nearby is sending signal on the same frequency as the other router nearby then BOTH CAN AFFECT EACH OTHERS SPEED. Some more details about that frequency: Most wifi routers we have in 2022 operate on 2.4Ghz band which is composed of several channels which are just sub-frequency ranges over which the router chooses a specific frequency to transmits its data, so when there are many wifi devices around the possibility of a frequency match skyrockets. They estimated that a min of 15 hotspots nearby could dramatically curtail our wifi speed by a significant amount. Dual band routers where possible from Wifi 5. The newer version of Wifi 6(802.11ax) is the latest and it ensures higher efficiency and theoretical download speeds. Earlier routers could only transmit data to a single user at a given time like they would perform rapid switching. Wifi 6 enables Multi-User Multi-Input-Multi-output(MU-MIMO) That would indicate many users could concurrently connect as well the router would transmit its beacons at multiple frequencies. The mind blowing fact was that if a neighboring wifi is slow but is far away that it affects us much more harshly than a wifi which is close and fast. I read the CISCO paper on the best practices in an office setting. THey recommended a mixture of 5Ghz(which is the most unoccupied band) and 2.4(which is the most crowded).
