### Apollo Server

Learned about Schema building, Start Apollo server, filling mocks, use studio for local development, manual query, manual type, learned about gql on server side, learned about query resolvers, apollo client cache, wrote a resolver, learned about resolver arguments, anatomy of a graphql request

### Axios

Made an axios request, learned some important options which might be useful like with credentials and basic auth. Want to explore proxy and content length limitation, valid status function might be useful for initial MVP.

### Websockets

What they are? Build over HTTP, diff between http 1 and 1.1, switching protocol code, websocket uses and building a demo app. WS is http underneath, Built a demo app, ws connection between localhost and chrome- works like realtime chat. 

### ComputerPhile

* Multithreading: its meaning and walkthrough, if not implemented correctly than how its a waste, how to prevent such scenarios like an interesting approach  was to prevent other threads from executing and overriding the common register. THey used mutexes to perform this kind of event locking.

* Learned that VPN is apparently over UDP not TCP. Sounds strange but havent known the reason yet.
