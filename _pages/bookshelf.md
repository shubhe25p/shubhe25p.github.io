My bookshelf is a work in progress. I tend to read many books in parallel, but occasionally I'll pick up something that's so captivating I can't put it down until it's finished. Books in bold are so fantastic they shaped who I am today. If you want to read some, read those. As always, I'd love to hear from you if you have any recommendations.
