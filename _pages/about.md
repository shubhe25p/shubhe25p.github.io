Thank you for visiting my website!

I am an incoming Computer Science graduate student at San Francisco State University. 

Previously, I graduated wit Bachelor in Technology(B.Tech) in Electrical Engineering from (Nirma University, India)[https://nirmauni.ac.in/]. 

My research endeavors have compelled me to think about the synergy between neuroscience and deep learning for which I was accepted by ICLR for their Co-Submitting Summer workshop. I am also interested in making these machine learning systems more interpretable in medical domains.

I work as a Software Engineer at (Bharat Tech Labs, India)[https://bharattechlabs.com/] and I am selected as a Teaching Assistant at (Neuromatch Academy)[https://academy.neuromatch.io/] for their Deep Learning Summer School. 

Feel free to get in touch for collaborating or for a chat! While I am not working, I mostly spend my time tweeting about Physics, Philosophy, History, Biology and Computer Networks.
