Thank you for visiting my website!

I am an incoming Computer Science graduate student at San Francisco State University. 

Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor in Technology(B.Tech) in Electrical Engineering from [Nirma University, India](https://nirmauni.ac.in/). 

My research [endeavors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r1bcA2OF9nx-_5cZ0RzkHRtnXUAPIkzi/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) have compelled me to think about the synergy between neuroscience and deep learning.

I work as a Software Engineer at [Bharat Tech Labs, India](https://bharattechlabs.com/) and I am also selected as a Teaching Assistant at [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/) for their Deep Learning Summer School. 

While I am not working, I mostly spend my time learning and sharing about Physics, Philosophy, History, Evolution, Computer Networks, Distributed Systems and Machine Learning.(list is endless!)

Feel free to get in touch for collaborating or for a chat!
